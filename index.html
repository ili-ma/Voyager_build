			<h1>CONSENT FORM FOR ONLINE AMAZON MECHANICAL TURK PARTICIPANTS (IRB-FY2016-231)</h1>
			<p><span class="section">Introduction:</span> The purpose of this study is to investigate how people learn in dynamic tasks. It will be
			conducted by Professor Todd M. Gureckis who is the principal investigator, at the Department of Psychology,
			Faculty of Arts & Science, New York University.</p>
			<p><span class="section">Procedure:</span> If you agree to take part in the study, you may be asked to: look at pictures of objects (e.g.,
			geometric figures or everyday objects) presented on a computer display, listen to sounds, or observe lights
			controlled by the computer and to make judgments about them using a keyboard, mouse, or switch attached to
			a computer.</p>
			<p><span class="section">Risks of Harm:</span> There are no known risks associated with participating in this research.</p>
			<p id="details"><span class="section">Payments, Fees or Other Incentives:</span> Participation in this study will take about {4}
			minutes to complete, and you will receive ${0:f2} for your participation. As an additional incentive to try your best at the task,
			you may earn a cash bonus of less than ${1:f2} based on your
			performance (expected bonus for average play is ${6:f2}). Participation in the study is voluntary and you may withdraw at any time. If you
			withdraw, you will be paid a portion of the full compensation based on the percentage of the study
			completed.</p>
			<p><span class="section">Benefits:</span> You will receive no direct benefits from participating in this study. However, it may make you
			more aware of how knowledge is discovered in psychology. It may also help researchers better
			understand how people remember aspects of narratives.</p>
			<p><span class="section">Subject’s Rights:</span> Participation in this study is completely voluntary. Not participating or withdrawing
			will result in no penalties. You have the right to skip or not answer any questions you prefer not to
			answer. Once participating, you may withdraw at any time.</p>
			<p><span class="section">Confidentiality:</span> Confidentiality of your responses in the study will be maintained by giving all subject
			data a numerical code. Any specific identifying information will be disclosed only to the investigators
			and their senior research team. Data are transmitted via a connection provided by Amazon Web
			Services and are encrypted using SSL. However, as with all information transmitted over the internet,
			the absolute security, and therefore, confidentiality, of your data cannot be guaranteed.
			Because payment for participation in this study is linked to your Amazon account, the fact that you
			have participated in some or all of this study is not confidential. The results of this study may be
			published in a book or journal or used for teaching purposes. However, your name or other identifiers
			will not be used in any publication or teaching. Following completion of the study, all individual
			identifiers will be destroyed and data will be archived with the laboratory of Professor Todd Gureckis.</p>
			<p class="summary">The investigator and the above have informed you about this study and answered your current
			questions to your satisfaction. Therefore, you agree to participate in it. If there is anything about the
			study or your participation that is unclear or that you do not understand, if you have questions or wish
			to report a research-related problem, you may contact the principal investigator, Dr. Todd Gureckis, at
			the Department of Psychology, 6 Washington Place, Room 859 by email todd.gureckis@nyu.edu or
			phone (212) 998-3794. For questions about subjects’ rights as a research participant, you may contact
			the University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (UCAIHS), NYU, (212) 998-4808 or
			human.subjects@nyu.eduask.humansubjects@nyu.edu.</p>
